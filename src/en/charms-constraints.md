Title: Using constraints

# Using constraints

A *constraint* declares a minimum value for a hardware specification of a
machine that is spawned by Juju.

The list of constraints is found in
[Reference: Juju constraints][reference-constraints].

!!! Note:
    Some constraints are only supported by certain clouds.

## How constraints work

### Satisfying a constraint

When Juju causes a machine to be created, the resulting machine will exceed the
constraint-defined minimum if the backing cloud is unable to satisfy the
constraint precisely. However, if the cloud cannot satisfy the constraint at
all then an error will be emitted and a machine will not be provisioned.

### Constraint scopes

Constraints may be set during the creation of the controller and are used to
set minimum specifications for Juju machines. Constraints that apply to all
machines in the models managed by the controller, but excluding the controller
itself, are known as **model constraints**. These are set via the
`--constraints` option. Constraints that apply to solely the controller are
known as **controller constraints** and are set by using the
`--bootstrap-constraints` option. The same values can be used by either type.

### Constraint defaults

Constraint defaults can be set on a per-controller basis, on a per-model basis
(`set-model-constraints`), or on a per-application basis (`set-constraints`).
Constraints set on the environment or on an application can be viewed by using
the get- constraints command. In addition, you can specify constraints when
executing a command by using the `--constraints` flag (for commands that
support it).

### Constraint precedence 

Constraints specified on the environment and an application will be combined to
determine the full list of constraints on the machine(s) to be provisioned by
the command. Application-specific constraints will override environment-specific
constraints, which override the juju default constraints.

Constraints may be set for models and
applications, with application constraints taking precedence. Changes to
constraints do not affect any units which have already been placed on machines.

To ignore any constraints which may have been previously set, you can assign a 
'null' value. 

### Adding a machine with constraints

There are two scenarios where you might want to specify a constraint when
adding a machine (`juju add-machine`):

 1. You intend to later deploy a charm or bundle (`juju deploy`) to the
    machine. Note that you can also simply specify the constraint during the
    deployment.
 1. You intend to scale out an application (`juju add-unit`) using a different
    constraint that was used during the initial deployment. Note that
    constraints are, by default, preserved on a per-application basis.

## Examples

### Setting constraints when deploying a charm

To deploy the 'mariadb' charm to a machine that has at least 4 GiB of memory:
  
```bash
juju deploy mariadb --constraints mem=4G
```

To deploy MySQL on a machine that has at least 6 GiB of memory and 2 CPUs:
  
```bash
juju deploy mysql --constraints "mem=6G cores=2"
```

To deploy Apache and ensure its machine will have 4 GiB of memory (or more) as
well as ignore a possible `cores` constraint (previously set at either the
model or application level):
  
```bash
juju deploy apache2 --constraints "mem=4G cores=" 
```
    
### Setting constraints for a controller

Constraints can be applied to a controller during its creation
(`juju bootstrap`) by using the `--bootstrap-constraints` option. See
[Creating a controller][controllers-creating] for details and examples.

### Setting constraints for all models

All models within a controller can have their constraints set during the
controller-creation process by applying the `--constraints` option to the
`bootstrap` command. See [Creating a controller][controllers-creating] for
guidance on doing this.

Default model constraints can be overridden for specific models, applications,
or machines, as detailed below.

Model-related constraints can also be overridden at the application and machine
level.

### Setting constraints for a single model

To set a memory constraint at the model level so any machines created within it
will also have the constraint assigned:
  
```bash
juju set-model-constraints mem=4G
```

Current model constraints can be shown with:

```bash
juju get-model-constraints
```

Reset a model constraint by assigning the null value to it:
 
```bash
juju set-model-constraints mem=
```

### Setting constraints for an application

Usually, constraints for an application are set at deploy time, by passing the 
required parameters using the deploy command:
  
```bash
juju deploy mariadb cores=4
```

Subsequently, you can set constraints for the any additional units added to the 
application by running:
  
```bash
juju set-constraints mariadb cores=2
```

The constraints work on a named-application as well. So the following also
works as expected:
  
```bash
juju deploy mariadb database1
juju deploy mariadb database2
juju set-constraints database1 mem=4096M
```

You can fetch the current constraints like this:
  
```bash
juju get-constraints mariadb
juju get-constraints database1
```

### Setting constraints when adding a machine

Add a machine that is connected to both the 'storage' and 'db' network spaces
(see [Network spaces][network-spaces]):

```bash 
juju add-machine --constraints spaces=storage,db
```

You can subsequently deploy applications to the above machine using the `--to`
switch with the `deploy` command. See
[Deploying to specific machines][charms-deploying-to-option] for how to do
this.

Both positive and negative entries are accepted, the latter prefixed by '^', in
a comma-delimited list. For example, given the following:

```no-highlight
--constraints spaces=db-space,^storage,^dmz,internal
```

Juju will provision instances connected to one of the subnets of both
'db-space' and 'internal' spaces, and **not** connected to either the 'storage'
or 'dmz' spaces.
